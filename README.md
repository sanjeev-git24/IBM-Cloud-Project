Problem statement 
In modern power distribution systems, Power distribution systems are highly susceptible to faults such as line breakage, transformer failure, and overheating. These faults can severely disrupt electricity supply, cause equipment damage, and increase operational costs. Traditional methods of fault detection often rely on manual inspection or rule-based systems, which can be slow, inaccurate, and inefficient in real-time scenarios.
With the growing complexity of modern electrical networks, there is a critical need for intelligent systems that can detect and classify various fault types using real-time electrical measurements. Accurate and timely fault identification is essential for maintaining power grid stability, minimizing downtime, and improving overall system resilience.

The developed system for Power System Fault Detection and Classification successfully leveraged IBM Watsonx.ai and AutoAI to build an efficient machine learning model. The use of the Random Forest Classifier provided accurate classification of different fault types, including line breakage, transformer failure, and overheating.
By automating model training and deployment through Watsonx.ai, the project achieved:
Streamlined development workflow
Effective fault categorization
Scalable and cloud-deployable architecture
This solution demonstrates how AI and cloud technologies can significantly enhance power grid monitoring and fault response, leading to improved operational reliability and reduced downtime.
